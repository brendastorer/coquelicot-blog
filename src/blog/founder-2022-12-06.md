Our founder, Brenda Storer, is also a designer and developer and the creator of "Whisk".

  The "we" of Coquelicot is the singular Brenda. And she's the one writing this article. And it feels weird to write it in the third person.

   So....ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brenda and I created this agency, Coquelicot, two years ago when I decided to go all in as a freelancer instead of looking for a new full-time job. I was working as a Senior Software Engineer in the travel industry and our entire tech team was laid off at the start of the pandemic. I'm now focused on building beautiful, resiliant, and performant Shopify themes. It brings together all of my experiences as web developer, designer, and as an avid online shopper. I love helping to enable the success of small businesses by offering professional and high quality Shopify themes. I'm an entreprenuer just like my customers. When you email for help and support at Coquelicot, it's a direct line to me.

<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>
   I'm a Silicon Valley California native who moved to New York City over two decades ago to pursue a creative career outside of the tech industry that dominated my hometown, only to realize that tech is actually pretty creative and awesome. I've been building websites since the 90s when I spent my free time creating Geocities fan pages for Leonardo DiCaprio, Spice Girls, and Robbie Williams.
</p>
<p>
  I graduated university with degrees in Psychology and Communication Design and spent my first working years in and out of college in customer service as a bartender, server, retail associate, and in the front of house at professional theaters in New York City and London, unsure what my long term career path should be. My very first web project was designing an e-commerce site built on Magento for an ayurvedic spa's skincare line in 2009. I didn't consider myself a professional developer then, but the original developers the spa hired were not very dedicated and frustratingly, ended up ghosting us and abandoning the project midway. I rolled up my sleeves and dug into the code, and found out that I loved building websites as much as I loved designing them. I took over managing the project as a whole and helped the spa hire an experienced and reputable developer to work alongside. The store turned out to be a massive success that has only grown since (and has recently migrated to Shopify ðŸ’š).
</p>
<p>
  In the past 10+ years since, I've worked at agencies, in-house at product companies, and as an independent designer, developer, and project manager with companies of all industries and sizes, but my favorite projects were always in e-commerce and with new businesses just getting started. I've been a part of stores that were built 100% from scratch where we also built the administrative side of the site without using a service like Shopify (checkout <a href="https://www.joydrive.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Joydrive</a> and <a href="https://www.contexttravel.com" target="_blank">Context Travel</a>), but once I worked with Shopify, it was love at first byte. <a href="https://www.mylola.com" target="_blank">Lola</a>, <a href="https://hivebrands.com/" target="_blank">Hive Brands</a>, <a href="https://onggi.com/" target="_blank">Onggi</a>, and <a href="https://bijanmustardson.com/" target="_blank">Bijan Mustardson</a> are a few of the Shopify stores I've helped create in the past few years. 
</p>
<p>
  I've been a speaker at developer conferences on three continents, and was awarded "Best Conference Presentation" at CSSDevConf in 2017, an honor that was voted on by the conference attendees. I also write about more technical code things on my personal website <a href="https://brendastorer.com" target="_blank">brendastorer.com</a>,
</p>
<p>
  When not working on websites or online shopping, you can find me at a broadway show, a hip hop dance class, hiking, singing 80s hair metal jams at karaoke, making my own candles and soaps, or sipping a dram or two of scotch (hopefully while in the Scottish highlands).

  Coquelicot's first theme for the Shopify Theme Store <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/themes/whisk/styles/soft" target="_blank">"Whisk"</a> is a culmination of not just my design and development experience, but my life experiences and personal interests. It really is a passion project that I'm so excited to share to help you be successful. There's a lot more coming for Whisk and Coquelicot. Sign up for our newsletter below if you want to hear about updates to Whisk and new themes when they launch. Or feel free to email me just to say hi.
